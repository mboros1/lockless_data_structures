LockFreeQueue is a lock-free implementation of a queue data structure in C++. It is based on the paper "Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms" by Maged M. Michael and Michael L. Scott, which describes a concurrent queue algorithm that uses atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) operations to implement non-blocking push and pop operations.

LockFreeQueue is implemented as a linked list with atomic pointers to the head and tail nodes. The queue provides thread-safe push and pop operations using CAS operations, as well as thread-safe iteration using an iterator class. The queue also uses reference counting to avoid dangling pointers and memory leaks.

LockFreeQueue is implemented as a template class, so it can store values of any type. It is defined in the header file lock_free_queue.h and can be used by including this header in your code and creating an instance of the LockFreeQueue class with the desired value type.
